            <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"> Mathematics</a> is the systematic study of numbers, shapes, patterns, structures, and relationships using logical reasoning and abstraction. It is a fundamental discipline that plays a crucial role in understanding the natural world, modeling phenomena, and solving practical problems.
                Mathematics simply means to learn or to study or gain knowledge. The theories and concepts given in mathematics help us understand and solve various types of problems in academic as well as in real life situations.

                Mathematics is a subject of logic. Learning mathematics will help students to grow their problem-solving and logical reasoning skills. Solving mathematical problems is one of the best brain exercises.</p>

             <p>
             

The history of mathematics is a story of human ingenuity and discovery spanning thousands of years. It began with early civilizations like the Egyptians and Babylonians around 3000 BCE, who developed basic arithmetic and geometry for practical purposes such as commerce and construction. Ancient Greece then formalized mathematical principles with figures like Euclid, who authored the foundational "Elements" of geometry, and Archimedes, who made significant advances in calculus and physics. The Middle Ages saw mathematics flourish in the Islamic world through scholars like Al-Khwarizmi, who introduced algebra and the concept of algorithms. In Europe, the Renaissance sparked a revival of mathematical inquiry with developments in algebra and calculus by thinkers like Descartes and Newton. The 18th and 19th centuries witnessed the formalization of mathematics into rigorous disciplines such as analysis and number theory, laying the groundwork for modern mathematics. The 20th century brought further revolutions with advancements in abstract algebra, topology, and the advent of computers, profoundly shaping mathematics and its applications in fields ranging from physics to economics. Today, mathematics continues to evolve, driving technological innovation and deepening our understanding of the universe.

              Number Theory
            </a>
            </h2>
            Number theory began with the manipulation of numbers, that is, natural numbers ( N ) , {\displaystyle (\mathbb {N} ),} and later expanded to integers ( Z ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} )} and rational numbers ( Q ) . {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Q} ).} Number theory was once called arithmetic, but nowadays this term is mostly used for numerical calculations.[28] Number theory dates back to ancient Babylon and probably China. Two prominent early number theorists were Euclid of ancient Greece and Diophantus of Alexandria.[29] The modern study of number theory in its abstract form is largely attributed to Pierre de Fermat and Leonhard Euler. The field came to full fruition with the contributions of Adrien-Marie Legendre and Carl Friedrich Gauss.[30]

            Many easily stated number problems have solutions that require sophisticated methods, often from across mathematics. A prominent example is Fermat's Last Theorem. This conjecture was stated in 1637 by Pierre de Fermat, but it was proved only in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, who used tools including scheme theory from algebraic geometry, category theory, and homological algebra.[31] Another example is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Stated in 1742 by Christian Goldbach, it remains unproven despite considerable effort.[32]
            
            Number theory includes several subareas, including analytic number theory, algebraic number theory, geometry of numbers (method oriented), diophantine equations, and transcendence theory (problem oriented)</div>

              Geometry
            </a>
            </h2>
            Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It started with empirical recipes concerning shapes, such as lines, angles and circles, which were developed mainly for the needs of surveying and architecture, but has since blossomed out into many other subfields.[33]

            A fundamental innovation was the ancient Greeks' introduction of the concept of proofs, which require that every assertion must be proved. For example, it is not sufficient to verify by measurement that, say, two lengths are equal; their equality must be proven via reasoning from previously accepted results (theorems) and a few basic statements. The basic statements are not subject to proof because they are self-evident (postulates), or are part of the definition of the subject of study (axioms). This principle, foundational for all mathematics, was first elaborated for geometry, and was systematized by Euclid around 300 BC in his book Elements.[34][35]
            
            The resulting Euclidean geometry is the study of shapes and their arrangements constructed from lines, planes and circles in the Euclidean plane (plane geometry) and the three-dimensional Euclidean space.</div>

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra">
              Algebra
            </a>
            </h2>
            Algebra is the art of manipulating equations and formulas. Diophantus (3rd century) and al-Khwarizmi (9th century) were the two main precursors of algebra.[40][41] Diophantus solved some equations involving unknown natural numbers by deducing new relations until he obtained the solution.[42] Al-Khwarizmi introduced systematic methods for transforming equations, such as moving a term from one side of an equation into the other side.[43] The term algebra is derived from the Arabic word al-jabr meaning 'the reunion of broken parts' that he used for naming one of these methods in the title of his main treatise.[44][45]

            Algebra became an area in its own right only with François Viète (1540–1603), who introduced the use of variables for representing unknown or unspecified numbers.[46] Variables allow mathematicians to describe the operations that have to be done on the numbers represented using mathematical formulas.[47]
            
            Until the 19th century, algebra consisted mainly of the study of linear equations (presently linear algebra), and polynomial equations in a single unknown, which were called algebraic equations (a term still in use, although it may be ambiguous). During the 19th century, mathematicians began to use variables to represent things other than numbers (such as matrices, modular integers, and geometric transformations), on which generalizations of arithmetic operations are often valid.[48] The concept of algebraic structure addresses this, consisting of a set whose elements are unspecified, of operations acting on the elements of the set, and rules that these operations must follow. The scope of algebra thus grew to include the study of algebraic structures. This object of algebra was called modern algebra or abstract algebra, as established by the influence and works of Emmy Noether.</div>

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus">
              Calculus
            </a>
            </h2>
            Calculus, formerly called infinitesimal calculus, was introduced independently and simultaneously by 17th-century mathematicians Newton and Leibniz.[52] It is fundamentally the study of the relationship of variables that depend on each other. Calculus was expanded in the 18th century by Euler with the introduction of the concept of a function and many other results.[53] Presently, "calculus" refers mainly to the elementary part of this theory, and "analysis" is commonly used for advanced parts.[54]

            Analysis is further subdivided into real analysis, where variables represent real numbers, and complex analysis, where variables represent complex numbers. Analysis includes many subareas shared by other areas of mathematics which include:[27]
            
                Multivariable calculus
                Functional analysis, where variables represent varying functions;
                Integration, measure theory and potential theory, all strongly related with probability theory on a continuum;
                Ordinary differential equations;
                Partial differential equations;
                Numerical analysis, mainly devoted to the computation on computers of solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in many applications.</div>

              Discrete Mathematics
            </a>
            </h2>
            Discrete mathematics, broadly speaking, is the study of individual, countable mathematical objects. An example is the set of all integers.[55] Because the objects of study here are discrete, the methods of calculus and mathematical analysis do not directly apply.[d] Algorithms—especially their implementation and computational complexity—play a major role in discrete mathematics.[56]

            The four color theorem and optimal sphere packing were two major problems of discrete mathematics solved in the second half of the 20th century.[57] The P versus NP problem, which remains open to this day, is also important for discrete mathematics, since its solution would potentially impact a large number of computationally difficult problems.[58]
            
            Discrete mathematics includes:[27]
            
                Combinatorics, the art of enumerating mathematical objects that satisfy some given constraints. Originally, these objects were elements or subsets of a given set; this has been extended to various objects, which establishes a strong link between combinatorics and other parts of discrete mathematics. For example, discrete geometry includes counting configurations of geometric shapes
                Graph theory and hypergraphs
                Coding theory, including error correcting codes and a part of cryptography
                Matroid theory
                Discrete geometry
                Discrete probability distributions
                Game theory (although continuous games are also studied, most common games, such as chess and poker are discrete)
                Discrete optimization, including combinatorial optimization, integer programming, constraint programming</div>

              Set Theory and mathematical Logic
            </a>
            </h2>            
            The two subjects of mathematical logic and set theory have belonged to mathematics since the end of the 19th century.[59][60] Before this period, sets were not considered to be mathematical objects, and logic, although used for mathematical proofs, belonged to philosophy and was not specifically studied by mathematicians.[61]

            Before Cantor's study of infinite sets, mathematicians were reluctant to consider actually infinite collections, and considered infinity to be the result of endless enumeration. Cantor's work offended many mathematicians not only by considering actually infinite sets[62] but by showing that this implies different sizes of infinity, per Cantor's diagonal argument. This led to the controversy over Cantor's set theory.[63] In the same period, various areas of mathematics concluded the former intuitive definitions of the basic mathematical objects were insufficient for ensuring mathematical rigour.[64]
            
            This became the foundational crisis of mathematics.[65] It was eventually solved in mainstream mathematics by systematizing the axiomatic method inside a formalized set theory. Roughly speaking, each mathematical object is defined by the set of all similar objects and the properties that these objects must have.[25] For example, in Peano arithmetic, the natural numbers are defined by "zero is a number", "each number has a unique successor", "each number but zero has a unique predecessor", and some rules of reasoning.[66] This mathematical abstraction from reality is embodied in the modern philosophy of formalism, as founded by David Hilbert around 1910.</div>

            </h2>
            The field of statistics is a mathematical application that is employed for the collection and processing of data samples, using procedures based on mathematical methods especially probability theory. Statisticians generate data with random sampling or randomized experiments.[73]

            Statistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints. For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.[74] Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics overlaps with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.[</div>
